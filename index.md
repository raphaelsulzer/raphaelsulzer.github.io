## About Me

I am postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/titane/team/">Titane team</a> at INRIA and a research engineer at <a href="https://www.luxcarta.com/">LuxCarta Technology</a>. Before, I obtained my PhD at <a href="https://www.ign.fr/institut/identity-card">IGN</a>, the French national mapping agency for my dissertation "Learning Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds in the Wild". I also hold an MSc in Geomatics from <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a> and a BSc in Geodesy from the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">University of Stuttgart</a>. I have lectured on the topics of photogrammetry and GIS at <a href="https://ensg.eu/fr">ENSG</a>.
