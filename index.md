## About Me

I am postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/titane/team/">Titane team</a> at INRIA Sophia Antipolis and a research engineer at <a href="https://www.luxcarta.com/">LuxCarta Technology</a>. I obtained my PhD titled "Learning Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds in the Wild" at <a href="https://www.ign.fr/institut/identity-card">IGN</a> and <a href="https://imagine-lab.enpc.fr/">Imagine</a>. During my PhD, I have lectured on the topics of photogrammetry and GIS at <a href="https://ensg.eu/fr">ENSG</a>. I also hold an MSc in Geomatics from <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a> and a BSc in Geodesy from the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">University of Stuttgart</a>.
