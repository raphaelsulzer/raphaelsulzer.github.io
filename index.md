## About Me

I am postdoctoral researcher in the Titane team at INRIA and a research engineer at LuxCarta Technology. Before, I obtained my PhD at IGN, the French national mapping agency for my dissertation "Learning Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds in the Wild". I also hold an MSc in Geomatics from TU Delft and a BSc in Geodesy from the University of Stuttgart.

I have lectured on the topics of photogrammetry and GIS at **École National des Sciences Géographique**.
